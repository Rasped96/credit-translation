# 💝  Acknowledgement of contributions   
All project participants who contributed any amount of work, and provided their details, will be acknowledged as project contributors on the project page, report, presentations, and manuscript. We will mainly use a CRediT-like statement format, but we will also keep a more detailed record of individual contributions to specific tasks within the stages of the project. This record will be also made publicly availabe as part of the open project materials (as a publicly available dataset). You can request to have your details removed or obscured at any time.    

## 📄 Co-authorship  
Project participants with substantial and high-quality contributions (as defined below) will become co-authors of the manuscript.
They will contribute to any or all of these: translation, checking, website code, coordination, and/or report drafting.   

A substantial contribution can be achieved by performing any X or more of the tasks listed below 
  

IMPORTANT: Authorship is also coditional on reading and approving the final manuscript draft before submission and providing all personal information (e.g., name, affiliation, email) needed for the submission.     

Additional contribution oportunities will be available via data cleaning, analyses, visualisations and writing, as needed and at the discretion of the project leads.   

In the manuscript, first and last authorship positions will be reserved to the project leads (they could be co-first and co-last positions). Subsequent authorship positions will be determined by the total amount and quality of contributions, as in the project records. For equal contributions the order of mid-authorship will be alphabetic. All authors must read and approve the final manuscript draft before submission. The manuscript will contain a CRediT statement detailing the roles of individual authors and contributors.   

# 📍 Final notes   
Project leads reserve the right to interpret and change the contribution rules at any time, if such need arises. In case of any disputes decisions of project leads will be final.
